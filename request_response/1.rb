What are the required components of an HTTP request? What are the additional optional components?

Required: source, host, path
Additional: parameters, header, port

LS Solution
The HTTP method and the path are required, and form part of what is known as the start-line or request-line. As of HTTP 1.0, the HTTP version also forms part of the request-line. The Host header is a required component since HTTP 1.1. Parameters, all other headers, and message body are optional.

Technically speaking the 'path' portion of the request-line is known as the 'request-URI', and incorporates the actual path to the resource and the optional parameters if present. In practice, most people simply refer to this part of the request-line as the 'path'.
